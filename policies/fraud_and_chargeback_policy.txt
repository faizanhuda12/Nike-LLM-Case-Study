1. POLICY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This policy establishes procedures for handling fraud claims, unauthorized 
transactions, chargebacks, and identity verification. All customer service 
representatives must follow strict protocols to protect both customers and the 
company from fraudulent activity while providing appropriate support to 
legitimate fraud victims.

================================================================================
2. UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION CLAIMS
================================================================================

2.1 Initial Response
    When customer reports unauthorized transaction:
    - Take claim seriously and show empathy
    - Gather initial information: transaction date, amount, order number
    - Verify customer identity before discussing account details
    - Do NOT dismiss claim or assume customer error
    - Document all information immediately

2.2 Identity Verification Required
    Before processing any fraud-related request, customer MUST verify identity:
    
    Required verification methods (at least TWO of the following):
    a) Account password or security question answer
    b) Last 4 digits of payment method used
    c) Billing address verification
    d) Email verification (click link sent to account email)
    e) Phone verification (call to registered phone number)
    f) Government-issued ID (for high-value claims)
    
    If customer cannot verify identity, escalate to fraud specialist team.
    Do NOT process refunds or make account changes without verification.

2.3 Investigation Process
    Upon verified fraud claim:
    - Immediately flag account for security review
    - Freeze account if multiple suspicious activities detected
    - Review recent account activity and order history
    - Check for patterns indicating account compromise
    - Document all findings in fraud case management system

2.4 Immediate Actions
    For confirmed unauthorized transactions:
    - Cancel unauthorized orders if not yet shipped
    - Issue full refund for unauthorized charges
    - Recommend customer contact bank/card issuer to report fraud
    - Advise customer to change account password immediately
    - Suggest customer monitor credit reports if identity theft suspected

================================================================================
3. CHARGEBACK PROCESS
================================================================================

3.1 Chargeback Definition
    A chargeback occurs when a customer disputes a charge directly with their
    bank or card issuer. The bank reverses the payment and we are notified.
    Chargebacks can occur for:
    - Unauthorized transaction claims
    - Product not received claims
    - Product not as described claims
    - Duplicate charge claims
    - Refund not received claims

3.2 Chargeback Notification
    When we receive chargeback notification:
    - Review order details and customer interaction history
    - Check if issue was previously reported and resolved
    - Gather evidence: order confirmation, shipping confirmation, delivery
      confirmation, customer communications
    - Determine if chargeback is legitimate or can be contested

3.3 Chargeback Response
    We have limited time (typically 7-14 days) to respond to chargeback:
    
    If chargeback is legitimate (we made an error):
    - Accept chargeback
    - Do not contest
    - Document lesson learned
    
    If chargeback appears fraudulent or incorrect:
    - Contest with evidence (order details, delivery confirmation, etc.)
    - Provide all relevant documentation
    - Submit response within deadline
    - Monitor outcome

3.4 Customer Communication During Chargeback
    - If customer contacts us about chargeback they initiated:
      - Acknowledge we received chargeback notification
      - Explain we are reviewing the case
      - If we have evidence order was legitimate, explain our position
      - Offer to resolve directly if customer withdraws chargeback
      - Maintain professional tone even if chargeback seems unwarranted
