PROMOTIONS AND PRICING POLICY
Effective Date: January 1, 2024
Policy Number: CS-POL-003
Version: 2.3

================================================================================
1. POLICY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This policy governs all promotional offers, discounts, pricing adjustments, 
price matching, and related customer inquiries. All customer service 
representatives must strictly adhere to these guidelines to ensure consistent 
application of promotional terms and prevent unauthorized discounts.

================================================================================
2. RETROACTIVE PROMOTIONS
================================================================================

2.1 General Rule: NO RETROACTIVE APPLICATIONS
    Promotional codes, discounts, and sale prices apply ONLY to purchases made
    DURING the active promotion period. We do NOT apply promotions retroactively
    to orders placed before a promotion begins, even if the promotion starts
    shortly after the original purchase date.

2.2 Promotion Period Definition
    - Start Date: Promotion begins at 12:01 AM in the promotion's primary
      time zone (typically Eastern Time for US promotions)
    - End Date: Promotion ends at 11:59 PM in the promotion's primary time zone
    - Orders must be placed AND confirmed within this window to qualify

2.3 Exceptions to Retroactive Rule
    The following situations MAY qualify for retroactive price adjustment
    (requires supervisor approval):
    
    a) Order placed within 24 hours before promotion start AND customer
       contacts us within 48 hours of promotion start
    b) Technical error prevented customer from applying valid promotion code
       at time of purchase (verified through system logs)
    c) Customer service error where representative incorrectly stated promotion
       would apply retroactively
    
    All exceptions require:
    - Supervisor approval
    - Documentation of circumstances
    - One-time courtesy adjustment notation in customer account

2.4 Price Protection Window
    We offer price protection for purchases made within 7 days if price drops
    occur on the same item (same SKU, same size, same color). This applies to:
    - Regular price reductions
    - New promotions on previously purchased items
    - Clearance price reductions
    
    Price protection does NOT apply to:
    - Limited-time flash sales
    - Clearance items already purchased at clearance price
    - Items purchased with other promotional codes

================================================================================
3. PROMOTION CODE STACKING
================================================================================

3.1 General Rule: NO STACKING
    Unless explicitly stated in the promotion terms, promotional codes and
    discounts CANNOT be combined or "stacked." Only ONE promotional code may
    be applied per order.

3.2 Stacking Prohibited Combinations
    The following combinations are NEVER allowed unless explicitly stated:
    - Multiple percentage-off codes
    - Percentage-off code + dollar-amount discount code
    - Promotional code + automatic sale discount
    - Student discount + promotional code
    - Employee discount + promotional code (except as per employee policy)
    - Referral discount + promotional code

3.3 Explicitly Allowed Stacking
    Some promotions explicitly allow stacking. These will be clearly stated in:
    - Promotion email or advertisement
    - Promotion terms and conditions
    - Checkout page when codes are applied
    
    When stacking is allowed, it will be clearly communicated. If not explicitly
    stated, assume stacking is NOT allowed.

3.4 Automatic Discounts
    Site-wide sales and automatic discounts (applied without code) may be
    combined with certain promotional codes ONLY if explicitly stated in
    promotion terms. When in doubt, do NOT allow stacking.
