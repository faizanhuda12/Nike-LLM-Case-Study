10. WARRANTY VS. RETURN POLICY
================================================================================

10.1 Distinction
    - Return Policy: Covers returns within return window (30-60 days) for
      any reason, subject to condition requirements
    - Warranty Policy: Covers manufacturing defects for 1 year, regardless
      of condition or return window

10.2 Overlapping Claims
    If item has manufacturing defect within return window:
    - Customer may choose return process OR warranty process
    - Return process typically faster (immediate refund/replacement)
    - Warranty process available if return window expired
    - Both processes available for defective items

================================================================================
11. ESCALATION CRITERIA
================================================================================

Escalate warranty claims to supervisor or specialist for:
- High-value items (over $500)

- Warranty claims near or beyond 1-year limit with extenuating circumstances
