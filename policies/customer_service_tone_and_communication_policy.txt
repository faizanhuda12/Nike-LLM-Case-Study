Effective Date: January 1, 2024
Policy Number: CS-POL-012
Version: 2.0

================================================================================
1. POLICY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This policy establishes standards for customer service communication across 
all channels (chat, email, phone, agent-assist). It defines tone, language, 
formatting requirements, and communication best practices to ensure consistent, 
professional, and empathetic customer interactions that maintain brand standards.

================================================================================
2. COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

2.1 Core Principles
    All customer service communications must be:
    
    - Professional: Maintain business-appropriate language and tone
    - Concise: Get to the point without unnecessary verbosity
    - Empathetic: Acknowledge customer feelings and concerns
    - Clear: Use plain language, avoid jargon when possible
    - Accurate: Provide correct information, admit when uncertain
    - Helpful: Focus on solving customer's problem
    - Brand-Aligned: Reflect company values and brand voice

2.2 No Guarantees Beyond Policy
    - Never promise outcomes not guaranteed by policy
    - Do not make commitments we cannot keep
    - Set realistic expectations
    - If exception possible, explain it requires approval, don't guarantee it

================================================================================
3. TONE GUIDELINES BY SITUATION
================================================================================

3.1 Positive Interactions
    When customer is satisfied or issue resolved easily:
    - Warm and friendly tone
    - Express appreciation for their business
    - Offer additional assistance
    - End on positive note
    
    Example: "I'm so glad I could help! Is there anything else I can assist
    you with today?"

3.2 Problem Resolution
    When addressing customer issues:
    - Acknowledge the problem first
    - Show empathy for inconvenience
    - Explain solution clearly
    - Confirm understanding
    
    Example: "I understand how frustrating this must be. Let me help resolve
    this for you right away."

3.3 Policy Limitations
    When policy prevents desired outcome:
    - Acknowledge customer's request
    - Explain policy clearly and empathetically
    - Offer alternatives when possible
    - Maintain helpful tone even when saying no
    
    Example: "I wish I could apply that promotion retroactively, but our
    policy doesn't allow it. However, I can help you with [alternative]."

3.4 Escalation Situations
    When issue requires escalation:
    - Explain why escalation needed
    - Set expectations for resolution timeline
    - Provide next steps clearly
    - Reassure customer they're being helped
    
    Example: "This situation requires additional review to ensure we handle
    it correctly. I'm escalating this to our specialist team who will
    contact you within [timeframe]."

3.5 Apology Situations
    When we made an error:
    - Apologize sincerely and specifically
    - Take responsibility
    - Explain what we're doing to fix it
    - Offer appropriate compensation
    
    Example: "I sincerely apologize for the error in your order. This was
    our mistake, and I'm taking steps to resolve it immediately."

================================================================================
4. LANGUAGE AND WORD CHOICE
================================================================================

4.1 Use Plain Language
    - Avoid jargon and technical terms when possible
    - If technical terms necessary, explain them
    - Use customer's language level as guide
    - Prefer simple words over complex ones
    
    Good: "Your refund will process in 5-10 business days."
    Avoid: "Your refund will be remitted via ACH transfer within the standard
           settlement window."

4.2 Positive Framing
    Frame messages positively when possible:
    - "I can help you with that" vs. "I can't do that, but..."
    - "Here's what we can do" vs. "We can't do that"
    - Focus on solutions, not limitations
    
    However, be direct when policy is clear - don't be overly positive about
    things we cannot do.

4.3 Avoid Negative Language
    Minimize use of:
    - "Unfortunately" (overused, sounds scripted)
    - "I'm sorry but..." (sounds dismissive)
    - "You should have..." (blaming)
    - "That's not my problem" (never appropriate)
    
    Instead:
    - "I understand, and here's what we can do..."
    - "Let me help you with that..."
    - "Here's how we can resolve this..."

4.4 Professional Language
    Always use:
    - Proper grammar and spelling
    - Complete sentences
    - Professional vocabulary
    - Appropriate formality level
    
    Avoid:
    - Slang or casual language
    - Abbreviations (unless standard like "ASAP" in appropriate context)
    - Emojis (unless brand guidelines specifically allow)
    - ALL CAPS (appears shouting)

================================================================================
5. STRUCTURED OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

5.1 JSON Response Format
    When providing structured responses (for system integration):
    - Always return valid JSON
    - Include all required fields: decision, reason, customer_response,
      next_action, escalation_required
    - Ensure JSON is properly formatted and parseable
    - Validate JSON before sending

5.2 Customer Response Field
    The customer_response field must:
    - Be written in natural, conversational language (not JSON-like)
    - Be ready to send directly to customer
    - Follow tone guidelines (Section 3)
    - Be concise but complete
    - Address customer's specific situation

5.3 Decision and Reason Fields
    - Decision: Clear, standardized value (Eligible, Not Eligible, In
      Progress, Escalate)
    - Reason: Brief explanation for decision (used internally and can be
      shared with customer)
    - Both must align with policy

5.4 Next Action Field
    - Provide clear next step
    - Be specific and actionable
    - Examples: "Process refund", "Escalate to supervisor", "Monitor delivery",
      "Proceed per policy"

    - "I can see why this would be concerning"
    - "I appreciate your patience"
    - "Thank you for bringing this to our attention"
    
    Don't overuse - be genuine, not scripted.

    Show customer their concern is valid:
    - "You're right to be concerned about..."
    - "That's a valid question"
    - "I understand why you'd want..."
    
    Even when policy prevents desired outcome, validate that their request
    makes sense.

7.3 Avoid Dismissive Language
    Never:
    - "That's just our policy" (sounds dismissive)
    - "Everyone has to follow the same rules" (sounds condescending)
    - "I don't make the rules" (passes blame)
    
    Instead:
    - "I understand, and here's why the policy exists..."
    - "Let me explain how we can work within the policy..."
    - "I wish I could help with that, and here's what we can do instead..."
