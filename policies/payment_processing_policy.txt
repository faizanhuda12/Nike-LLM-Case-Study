================================================================================
3. PENDING CHARGES AND AUTHORIZATION HOLDS
================================================================================

3.1 Authorization Holds
    When an order is placed, we place an authorization hold (not an actual
    charge) on the payment method to ensure funds are available. This hold:
    - Appears as a "pending" transaction on customer's account
    - Does NOT represent an actual charge until order ships
    - Typically releases within 1-3 business days if order is cancelled
    - May take up to 5 business days to release depending on bank/card issuer

3.2 Pending Charge Duration
    - Pre-shipment: Authorization hold remains until order ships
    - Post-shipment: Authorization converts to actual charge when order ships
    - Cancelled orders: Authorization hold releases within 1-5 business days
      (timing depends on bank/card issuer, not our control)

3.3 Customer Communication
    When customers inquire about pending charges:
    - Explain that pending charges are authorization holds, not actual charges
    - Clarify that charge becomes final when order ships
    - Inform that cancelled orders will have holds released within 5 business
      days
    - Provide order status and expected ship date if available
    - If pending charge exceeds 5 business days for cancelled order, escalate
      to payment specialist

3.4 Multiple Pending Charges
    If customer sees multiple pending charges for same order:
    - Check order status and payment history
    - Multiple holds may occur if order was modified or payment method updated
    - Extra holds should release automatically within 5 business days
    - If multiple charges persist beyond 5 business days, escalate to
      payment specialist for investigation

================================================================================

    - Suggest trying alternative payment method
    - If pattern of declines for valid payment methods, escalate to payment
      specialist

      payment method
    - No limit on retry attempts (subject to fraud prevention systems)

      before retrying
